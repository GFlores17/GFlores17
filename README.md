### Howdy! ðŸ¤  My name is George Flores.

My current goal is to recreate my last passion project (tournament managing software) as a mobile app using Dart/Android Studio (as opposed to the C++ based Desktop version I created prior).

NOTE: "Jackbox Tournament Manager" has no affiliation with Jackbox Games. I just wanted a way to track tournaments my friends and I would host last summer during the 1st half of quarantine.
